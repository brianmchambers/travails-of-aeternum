# Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors and community members to follow this code of conduct to ensure a welcoming, respectful, and productive environment.

Standards
- Be respectful and considerate in language and actions.
- Assume good faith when interacting with others.
- Focus on constructive feedback and code/design, not individuals.
- No harassment, discrimination, or abusive language/tactics.

Unacceptable behavior
Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Insults, slurs, or demeaning language
- Personal attacks, threats, or stalking
- Sustained disruption of conversations or work
- Displaying sexually explicit or violent content in community spaces

Reporting
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
- Preferably open a private issue addressed to the maintainers (create an issue and mark it as private or reference it as confidential).
- You may also contact the maintainers directly on GitHub: @brianmchambers
- Provide as much detail as you are comfortable sharing (what happened, when, who was involved, screenshots/logs).

Enforcement
Maintainers will review reports and take appropriate actions, which may include:
- Asking the offender to apologize or change behavior
- Temporary or permanent removal from project communication channels
- Banning from contributing or revoking commit access

This Code of Conduct is adapted from common community guidelines to keep our project friendly and inclusive. By participating in this project you agree to abide by these principles.
