# Travails of Æternum — Binding Atrium Vertical Slice Scope

## Vertical Slice Statement
A playable vertical slice demonstrating the pact-exchange core (swap/steal/fuse), a recruit liberation beat, the Binding Atrium dungeon, Memory‑Warden boss, and the Library Reading Room hub — with placeholder 16-bit art and one chiptune loop — delivered as a solo 9–11 day prototype.

## In-Scope (Must)
- Turn-based battle system with player/enemy turns.
- Pact model + actions: Swap, Steal (temporary), Fuse (1 deterministic rule).
- 4 sample pacts (including 1 fused result).
- 1 recruitable ally (Scribe-11) with a short liberation scene and 2 dialogue choices.
- Binding Atrium dungeon: 3–4 combats + Memory‑Warden boss.
- Library Reading Room hub with party screen, save, and inventory.
- Battle UI + tooltips + brief tutorial.
- Placeholder art, sprites, and one chiptune loop.
- Playtest with 3–5 players and synthesis of feedback.

## Out-of-Scope (Now)
- Multiplayer, online saves, or porting.
- Large fusion matrices / combinatorial designs.
- Full overworld with many regions (only single approach route).
- Full roster of recruitables (>1 fleshed-out).
- Polished final art and extensive voice work.
- Finalized endings or pantheon conclusion (only flags for later).

## Stretch Goals (If time)
- Extra recruit with short arc.
- One additional fusion rule.
- Extra music track and SFX.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can run Binding Atrium, beat Memory‑Warden, and recruit Scribe-11 in a 30–45 minute play session.
- Playtesters identify pact-exchange as the primary mechanic and can execute swap/steal/fuse after tutorial.
- Recruit liberation visibly changes moveset and is noticed by playtesters.
- No critical blocking bugs in the boss/recruit path.

## Sprint Policy
- Sprint length: 9–11 days. Scope freeze at sprint start.
- Unplanned work is logged to backlog; additions require scope review.
- Next sprint planning happens only after playtest retro and acceptance sign-off.
